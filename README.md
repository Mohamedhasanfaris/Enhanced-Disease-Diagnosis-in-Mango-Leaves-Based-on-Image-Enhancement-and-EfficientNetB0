# Enhanced_Disease_Diagnosis_in_Mango_Leaves_Based_on_Image_Enhancement_and_Efficientnet

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for detecting and diagnosing diseases in mango leaves using advanced image enhancement techniques and the EfficientNetB0 model. The system is deployed as an interactive web-based chatbot using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🌿 Disease detection for mango leaves with high accuracy
- 🧠 Uses EfficientNetB0 for lightweight, efficient classification
- 🖼️ Includes image enhancement: noise reduction, sharpening, and contrast improvement
- 💬 Web-based chatbot built using Gradio for real-time interaction
- 🧪 Trained on Mango Leaf Disease Dataset with 8 classes
- 📈 Evaluation with confusion matrix, classification report, and Grad-CAM visualizations
